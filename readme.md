# Flask-Tailwind-Alpine Starter

The starting point for a flask application using Alpine.js for the minimal interactivity and Tailwind.css for styling.

## Installation

1) Create virtualenv. This is system dependent, for me it was `python3 -m venv venv`

2) `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install all Python3 dependencies

3) `npm install` to install Tailwind.css and Alpine.js


## Running it

1) Get into your venv, for me it was executing `source venv/bin/activate` cmd from the project folder

2) Run `npm run dev` to start development server locally

3) The server should be running on `localhost:8000` and can be visited via browser
