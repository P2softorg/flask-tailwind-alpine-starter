# Flask-Tailwind-Alpine Starter

The starting point for a flask application using Alpine.js for the minimal interactivity and Tailwind.css for styling.

## Installation

1) Create virtualenv

2) `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install all Python3 dependencies

3) `npm install` to install Tailwind.css and Alpine.js


## Running it

1) Get into your venv, for me it was `source venv/bin/activate` from the project folder

2) `python -m flask run` to start development server locally
